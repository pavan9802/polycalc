# polycalc
Takes in a file input in the form of 

coeff    degree

coeff    degree

coeff    degree

For example if a file contains

2  7

3  5

1  3


This file will represent the polynomial 2x^7 + 3x^5 + x^3.

Make note that the degrees of the coeficients must be in descending order.

With this polynomical you can add, subtract and multiply it with another polynomical. There is also an option to evaluate the polynomial with a certain x value.
